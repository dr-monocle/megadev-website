                the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <p>My Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are

                have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent,
                I take steps to remove that information from My servers and databases.</p>
            <p>If I need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires
                consent from a parent, I may require Your parent's consent before I collect and use that information.
            </p>

                any third party sites or services.</p>
